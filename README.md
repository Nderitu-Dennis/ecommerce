# ecommerce
my school project for semester 3.2
This is the backend code for the ecommerce web app.
i used this project to learn and understand the MVC architecture and gained a deep insight into how springboot splits an app into data access layer, business logic layer and the controller layer.
i saw how the JPA Repository class performed CRUD operations on the database and conveyed the data to the business layer through dto's.
finally the controller layer communicated with the outside world that is the front end application through API's. i built the front end using Angular.
while this project is not solving any significant problem in the society, i used it to learn about Springboot,Postgres,API's and Angular-which were all foreign concepts prior to my undertaking of this project.
